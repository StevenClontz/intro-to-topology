  Let <m>\tuple{X,\mc T}</m> be a topological space. A subset <m>\mc B\subseteq\mc T</m>
  is called a <term>basis</term> for the topology if for every <m>x\in X</m>
  and neighborhood <m>U</m> of <m>x</m>, there exists <m>B\in\mc B</m> such that
  <m>x\in B\subseteq U</m>.
</p>
</definition>
<proposition>
<p>
  <m>\mc B=\setBuilder{(a,b)}{a,b\in\mb R}</m> is a basis for the Euclidean topology.
</p>
</proposition>
<theorem>
<p>Let <m>\mc B\subseteq\mc P(X)</m> satisfy the following properties:</p>
<ol>
<li>For all <m>x\in X</m>, there exists <m>B\in\mc B</m> such that <m>x\in B</m>.</li>
<li>If <m>x\in A\in\mc B</m> and <m>x\in B\in\mc B</m>, there exists <m>C\in\mc B</m>
  such that <m>x\in C\subseteq A\cap B</m>.</li>
</ol>
<p>Then <m>\mc T=\setBuilder{\bigcup\mc U}{\mc U\subseteq\mc B}</m> is a topology,
  and <m>\mc B</m> is a basis for that topology. We call this the
  <term>topology generated by the basis</term>.</p>
</theorem>
<proposition>
<p>
  <m>\mc B=\setBuilder{[a,b)}{a,b\in\mb R}</m> is a basis for a topology different
  from the Euclidean topology, called the <term>Sorgenfrey topology</term>.

<p>
  The set <m>\mc S\subseteq\mc P(X)</m> in <xref ref="subbasis"/> is
