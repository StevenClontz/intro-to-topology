  Let<m>Y</m> be a subset
  of a topological space <m>X</m> .
  A pair of open sets <m>\setList{A,B}</m>
  satisfying <m>A\cap Y\not=\emptyset</m>, <m>B\cap Y\not=\emptyset</m>, 
  <m>Y\subseteq A\cup B</m>, and <m>A\cap B\cap Y=\emptyset</m>
  is called a <term>disconnection</term> of <m>Y</m>. 
</p>
<p>
  A subset of a space for which a disconnection exists is called
  <term>disconnected</term>; otherwise, the space is called
  <term>connected</term>.

<corollary>
<p>A space itself is disconnected if and only if it is the union of two disjoint

<theorem>
<p>
  If a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space is connected,
  then <m>\cl A</m> is connected.

</theorem>
<proposition>
<p>
  If a subset <m>A</m> of a topological space <m>X</m> is connected
  and <m>f:X\to Y</m> is continuous,
  then <m>f[A]</m> is connected.

<corollary>
<p>Connectedness is a topological property.</p>
</corollary>
<proposition>
<p>
  Let <m>\setList{0,1}</m> have the discrete topology.
  Then a topological space <m>X</m> is connected if and only if
  every continuous function <m>f:X\to\setList{0,1}</m> is constant.
</p>
</proposition>
<theorem>
<p>
  If <m>\mc A</m> is a collection of connected subsets of a topological
  space with <m>\bigcap\mc A\not=\emptyset</m>, then <m>\bigcup\mc A</m>
  is connected.
</p>
</theorem>
<definition>
<p>
  Suppose for every two points <m>x,y\in A\subseteq X</m>, there exists
  a continuous function <m>f:[0,1]\to A</m> such that <m>f(0)=x</m>
  and <m>f(1)=y</m>. Such a space is said to be <term>path connected</term>.

<p>
  Let <me>S=
  \setBuilder{\tuple{x,y}}{x\in(0,1]\text{ and }
  y=\sin\left(\frac{1}{x}\right)}</me>
  (the <term>topologist's sine curve</term>).
  Then <m>\cl S</m> is a subset of the Euclidean space <m>\mb R^2</m>
  that is connected but not path connected.
