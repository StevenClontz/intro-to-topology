<title>Curves and Surfaces</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    In this section, we will develop an intuition for a
    topological space and the purpose of topology by
    investigating two natural examples of
    topological spaces: curves and
    surfaces.
  </p>
  <p>
    Unlike the rest of these notes, we will not rigorously
    define these concepts. (For example,
    what do I mean by <q>locally looks like</q>
    in <xref ref="curve-defn"/>?)  However,
    many of these ideas will return later in the course
    and be handled more carefully.
  </p>
</introduction>
<definition xml:id="curve-defn">
  <p>
    A <term>curve</term> is a set of points such
    that for every point in the set, the set locally
    looks like a (possibly bent or curved) copy of 
    the real line <m>\mathbb R</m> or 
    the half line <m>\mathbb R^*=\{x\in\mathbb R:x\geq 0\}</m>.
  </p> 
</definition>
<p>
  For example, <xref ref="circle-fig"/>, <xref ref="figure-parabola"/>,
  and <xref ref="figure-helix"/> are all examples of curves in
  two or three-dimensional Euclidean space.
</p>
<figure xml:id="circle-fig">
  <caption>A circle</caption><image source="images/circle.jpg"/>
</figure>
<figure xml:id="figure-parabola">
  <caption>A parabola</caption><image source="images/parabola.jpg"/>
</figure>
<figure xml:id="figure-helix">
  <caption>A helix</caption><image source="images/helix.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p>
  Note the following differences between <xref ref="circle-fig"/> and 
  <xref ref="figure-parabola"/>:
</p>
<ul>
  <li>
    Removing a point from
    <xref ref="figure-parabola"/>
    would split it into two disconnected parts, but
    <xref ref="circle-fig"/> 
    would remain connected after a point is removed.
  </li>
  <li>
    <xref ref="circle-fig"/> is bounded while <xref ref="figure-parabola"/>
    extends unboundedly.
    <fn>
      This topological distinction makes sense as both are closed subsets of 
      <m>\mathbb R^2</m>; see <xref ref="section-compact"/>
      for more info.
    </fn>
  </li>
</ul>
<p>
  These differences would remain no matter how the curves were
  stretched or bent. However, while there are certainly geometrical
  differences beteween
  <xref ref="figure-parabola"/>
  and
  <xref ref="figure-helix"/>,
  they are in a certain sense the same object that has been bent
  or stretched into a different shape.
</p>
<definition>
  <p>
    Two objects are said to be <term>topologically equivalent</term>
    or <term>homeomorphic</term> if one may be bent or stretched into
    the shape of the other.
  </p>
</definition>
<p>
  So this means that all geometrically similar shapes are homeomorphic
  (as in <xref ref="figure-similar-triangles"/>),
  but we also use the idea of homeomorphism to compare other objects
  in our daily lives.
</p>
<p>
  For example, while many of them are not curves by our definition,
  the letters of the alphabet may be considered as topological objects.
  <xref ref="figure-letter-a"/> illustrates several
  homeomorphic expressions of the letter <q>A</q>.
</p>
<figure xml:id="figure-similar-triangles">
  <caption>Two similar triangles</caption><image source="images/similar-triangles.jpg"/>
</figure>
<figure xml:id="figure-letter-a">
  <caption>The letter <q>A</q> in several fonts.</caption>
  <image source="images/letter-a.jpg"/>
</figure>
<p>
  A homeomorphism is more carefully defined in <xref ref="section-continuity"/>,
  but the central idea is that of <q>neighborhoods</q>. For each of the
  letters <q>A</q> in <xref ref="figure-letter-a"/>, note that there are
  two endpoints and two triad intersections 
  whose neighborhoods look different from the
  other neighborhoods within the letter; see
  <xref ref="figure-letter-a-neighborhoods"/>.
</p>

<definition xml:id="definition-surface"> 
  <p>
    A <term>surface</term> is a set of points such
    that for every point in the set, the set locally
    looks like a (possibly bent or curved) copy of 
    the plane <m>\mathbb R^2</m>
    or the half-plane 
    <m>\mathbb R^{2*}=\{\tuple{x,y}\in\mb R^2:x\geq 0\}</m>.
  </p> 
</definition>
<p>
  A classic example of the topology of surfaces is the following joke:
  <q>
    A topologist is a mathematician who cannot tell the difference
    between his doughnut and coffee cup.
  </q>
  The joke is a lot funnier<fn>Eh, maybe.</fn> once you've seen
  <url href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Mug_and_Torus_morph.gif">
    this animated GIF on Wikipedia
  </url>.
</p>
<p>
  The <q>doughnut</q>'s surface is known mathematically as a 
  <q>torus</q>, shown in <xref ref="figure-torus"/>. A sphere
  is shown in <xref ref="figure-sphere"/>, and a surface that
  cannot be cannot be embedded in <m>\mathbb R^3</m>, the Klein
  bottle, is shown in <xref ref="figure-klein-bottle"/>. 
</p>
<figure xml:id="figure-torus">
  <caption>A torus.</caption>
  <image source="images/torus.jpg"/>

  <image source="images/sphere.jpg"/>
</figure>
<figure xml:id="figure-klein-bottle">

  <image source="images/klein-bottle.png"/>
</figure>
<p>
  While these shapes appear very different, they can all be
  defined as a <q>quotient space</q> 
  (<xref ref="section-quotient"/>)
  of the unit square in <m>\mathbb R^2</m>.
</p>
<p>
  In order to study so-called <q>topological spaces</q> such as
  these, we will begin by distilling down the notion of a
  <q>neighborhood</q> for an arbitrary set.
