  <m>V</m> of <m>f(x)</m>, there exists a neighborhood <m>U</m>

<p>
  Let <m>f:X\to Y</m> be a bijection such that both <m>f</m> and
  its inverse <m>f^{-1}</m> are continuous. Then <m>f</m>

<exercise><title>Properties preserved by continuous functions</title>
<p>
  Determine if the following hold if <m>f:X\to Y</m> is 
  a continous surjection. If not, determine if they hold if <m>f</m>
  is a continuous bijection. If not, show that they hold if <m>f</m>
  is a homeomorphism.

  <!-- <li>If <m>X</m> is Hausdorff, then <m>Y</m> is Hausdorff.</li>
  <li>If <m>Y</m> is Hausdorff, then <m>X</m> is Hausdorff.</li> -->
  <li>If <m>U\subseteq X</m> is open, then <m>f[U]\subseteq Y</m> is open.</li>

<proposition>

<theorem>
<p>
  Let <m>a\lt b</m> and <m>c\lt d</m> be real numbers.
  Then <m>(a,b)</m> and <m>(c,d)</m> are homeomorphic subspaces
  of the Euclidean line.
</p>
</theorem>
<theorem>
<p>
  <m>\mb R</m> with the Euclidean topology is homeomorphic to 
  its subspace <m>(0,1)</m>.

<theorem>
<p>
  Let <m>\mc B</m> be a basis for the Euclidean topology on <m>\mb R</m>.
  Give <m>K=\mb R\cup\setList{-\infty,\infty}</m> the topology generated
  by the basis 
  <m>\setBuilder{[-\infty,x)}{x\in\mb Q}\cup
  \setBuilder{(x,\infty]}{x\in\mb Q}\cup\mc B</m>.

</theorem>
<proposition>
<p>
  The real line with the Sorgenfrey topology generated by the basis
  <m>\setBuilder{[a,b)}{a,b\in\mb R}</m> is homeomorphic to the
  real line with the reverse Sorgenfrey topology generated by the
  basis <m>\setBuilder{(a,b]}{a,b\in\mb R}</m>.

</proposition>
<proposition>
<p>
  A continuous bijection <m>f:X\to Y</m> is a homeomorphism if and only if
  for each <m>U\subseteq X</m> open, <m>f[U]\subseteq Y</m> is also open.
</p>
</proposition>
<example>
<p>
The topology on the real line generated by the basis <m>\{[a,b]:a,b\in\mathbb R\}</m>
is equal (not just homeomorphic!) to another topology we've previously defined for <m>\mathbb R</m>.
