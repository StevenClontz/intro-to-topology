  <introduction>
    <p>
      Here is a brief overview of basic results and definitions 
      concerning sets and the reals that should be assumed for
      this course.
    </p>
  </introduction>
<definition>
  <ul>
    <li><m>\mb R</m> is the set of real numbers.</li>
    <li><m>\mb Z</m> is the set of integers.</li>
    <li>
      <m>\omega=\setBuilder{z\in\mb Z}{z\geq 0}=\setList{0,1,2,\dots}</m>
      is the set of natural numbers, which includes zero.
    </li>
    <li>
      <m>\mb Q=\setBuilder{\frac{z}{n+1}}{z\in\mb Z,n\in\omega}</m>
      is the set of rational numbers.
    </li>
  </ul>

<theorem>
<p>
  <term>De Morgan's Laws</term>: Let <m>\mc A</m> be a collection of subsets of
  <m>X</m>.
</p>
<me>X\setminus\bigcup_{A\in\mc A}A=\bigcap_{A\in\mc A}(X\setminus A)</me>
<me>X\setminus\bigcap_{A\in\mc A}A=\bigcup_{A\in\mc A}(X\setminus A)</me>
</theorem>
<theorem>
<p>
  The <term>Archemedian Property</term> of the real numbers guarantees that
  for each positive real number <m>x>0</m>, there exists a natural number
  <m>n\in\omega</m> such that <m>\frac{1}{n}\lt x</m>.
</p>
</theorem>
<theorem>
<p>
  Let <m>S\subseteq \mb R</m> be a set of real numbers with a lower bound.
  Then there exists a <term>greatest lower bound</term> (a.k.a.
  <term>infimum</term>) <m>\glb S=\inf S</m>.
</p>
<p>
  Let <m>S\subseteq \mb R</m> be a set of real numbers with a lower bound.
  Then there exists a <term>least upper bound</term> (a.k.a.
  <term>supremum</term>) <m>\lub S=\sup S</m>.
</p>
</theorem>
<definition>
<p>
The <term>cardinality</term> of a finite set is the natural number that
is equal to the number of elements it contains. For example,
<m>S=\setL{-1,\setL{5,-e},\pi}</m> has cardinality
<m>|S|=3</m>.
</p>
<p>
A set <m>S</m> that has an injection with <m>\omega</m> is said to be
<term>countable</term> and have cardinality <m>|S|\leq\aleph_0</m>.
If a bijection exists, the set is <term>countably infinite</term> and has
cardinality <m>|S|=\alpha_0</m>.
</p>
<p>
A set <m>S</m> that has no injection with <m>\omega</m> is said to be
<term>uncountable</term> and have cardinality <m>|S|>\aleph_0</m>.
</p>
<p>
A set <m>S</m> that has a bijection with <m>\mb R</m> is said to be
<term>continuum-sized</term> and have cardinality <m>|S|=\mathfrak c</m>.
</p>
</definition>
<lemma>
<p>
For each <m>a,b\in\mathbb R\cup\setL{-\infty,\infty}</m>, the set
<m>(a,b)\cap\mathbb Q</m> is infinite and countable, and the set
<m>(a,b)\setminus\mathbb Q</m> is infinite and uncoutnable. In particular,
every subinterval <m>(a,b)</m> of <m>\mathbb R</m> contains a rational from
<m>\mathbb Q</m> and an irrational from <m>\mathbb R\setminus\mathbb Q</m>.
</p>
</lemma>
<lemma>
    <p>
For any functions <m>f:A\to B,g:B\to C</m> and <m>Z\subseteq C</m>,
<m>(g\circ f)^\leftarrow[Z]=f^\leftarrow[g^\leftarrow[Z]]</m>.
