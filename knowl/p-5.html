<div class="para">These notes have been written to serve as an introduction to topology for undergraduate or beginning graduate students of mathematics. Unlike a more comprehensive textbook, these notes are written to be used in an inquiry-based learning classroom. As such, no proofs have been provided. Instead, the results of the course have been carefully scaffolded to allow students to prove most of the theorems on their own, with the support of the instructor.</div>
