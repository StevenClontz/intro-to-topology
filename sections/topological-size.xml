<title>Topological Size</title>
<introduction>
  <p>
    Just as area or measure might be used to
    describe the size of certain subsets of
    Euclidean spaces in geometry or analysis,
    topologists also have notions of size.
    But since <q>stretching</q> should not
    affect the topological properties of
    a space, topological size instead considers
    the cardinality of certain types of subsets
    of the space or its topology.

<definition>
<p>
  A set is said to be <term>finite</term> if there
  exists an injection from that set to the
  set <m>\setList{0,1,\dots,n-1}</m> for some
  <m>n\in\mathbb N</m>. A set is <term>infinite</term>
  if it is not finite.
</p>
<p>
  A set is said to be <term>countable</term> if there
  exists an injection from that set to the
  set <m>\mb N</m>. A set is <term>uncountable</term>
  if it is not countable.
