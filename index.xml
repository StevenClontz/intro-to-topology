		  These are course notes for an introductory undergraduate or dual-listed
		  course for general topology, to be used in an inquiry-based learning classroom.

                These notes have been written to serve as an introduction to topology
                for undergraduate or beginning graduate students of mathematics.
                Unlike a more comprehensive textbook, these notes are written to be used
                in an inquiry-based learning classroom. As such, no proofs have been
                provided. Instead, the results of the course have been carefully
                scaffolded to allow students to prove most of the theorems on their
                own, with the support of the instructor.
              </p>
              <p>
                The exception to this format is <xref ref="section-surfaces"/>, which
                provides a short narrative to movitave the study of topology by discussing
                the neighborhoods of points in subspaces of <m>\mathbb R^3</m>, particularly 
                unions of curves and surfaces.
              </p>
              <p>
                The only prerequisite for this course is an undergraduate-level introduction
                to proofs course, which should include all the naive set theory necessary
                to study topology at the introductory level. <xref ref="assumptions"/> provides
                a few definitions and theorems that should be assumed for this course 
                (e.g. properties of the reals, <m>0\in\mathbb N</m>).
